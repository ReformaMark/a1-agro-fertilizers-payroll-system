Project Objectives

General Objective
The general objective of this research is to design and develop a web-based payroll and attendance monitoring system with biometrics tailored to A1 Agro Fertilizers and Chemical Supply's needs and policies. The aim is to automate attendance monitoring, payroll computations, tax withholdings, and general payroll reporting.
Specific Objectives

Design a prototype that corresponds with A1 Agro Fertilizers and Chemical Supply's distinctive needs and regulations.
1. Implement biometric capabilities in the prototype to monitor attendance reliably.
2. Address the challenges caused by the current manual payroll system through the development of a web-based system that automates processes.
3. Ensure the system has functionalities for appropriate tax withholding, reliable payroll computations, and automated attendance monitoring.
4. Extensively test the developed system to evaluate its usability, dependability, and functionality.
5. Identify and address any issues that were brought up during the testing stage to improve the overall functionality of the system.

Project Scope
The proposed system includes the following key modules:

1. Biometric Attendance Module: Automates employee attendance monitoring using biometric technology to enhance security and minimize attendance fraud.
2. Employee Database: Organizes important employee information for efficient workforce management and data-driven decision-making.
3. Payroll Calculation: Calculates employee salaries, applies deductions and taxes, and ensures compliance.
4. Loan Calculation: Automatically computes employee loans to improve accuracy.
5. Payslip Generation: Generates pay stubs for employees, maintaining financial records and transparency.
6. Settings: Allows administrators to configure system settings, monitor updates, and manage server status.
7. Reports Module: Provides various reports, including attendance, loans, and payroll summaries.
8. User Accounts Module: Enables administrators to manage user accounts and access permissions.
9. Content Management Module: Allows administrators to update text and pricing information.

The key limitation of the system is that it requires internet connectivity, as it is a web-based application. Users will only be able to access the system online, which may pose challenges in areas with inconsistent or limited internet access.
